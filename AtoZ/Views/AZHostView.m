/*** A "layer backed NSView" 
		1. can have subviews.  it is a normal view after all
		2. it uses a layer as "pixel backing storage", instead of the kind of storage views otherwise use.
		3. the backing layer of a NSView cannot have sublayers (there is no support for "layer hierarchies"). 

			 NSView *layerBacked = [NSView new];
			 [layerBacked setWantsLayer:YES];

	A "layer hosting" view
		1. cannot have subviews
		2. its sole purpose is to "host a layer"
		3. the layer it hosts can have sublayers and a very complex layer-tree-hierarchy.

			 NSView *layerHosting = [NSView new];
			 CALayer *layer = [CALayer new];
			 [layerHosting setLayer:layer];
